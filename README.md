# Limit_Results_Admixture_Model

This repository contains code to calculate the asymptotic variance of MLEs for the ancestry and the allele frequencies in the Admixture Model. Therefore, we consider different settings:

1) The true parameters are in the interior of the parameter space.
2) The true parameters are on the boundary of the parameter space.

The code is in the file Asymptotic_Distribution.py. Moreover, the file plots.py contains code to present the results. 

The repository also contains example output of ADMIXTURE (example_data.Q and example_data.P).
